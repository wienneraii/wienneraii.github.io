<h3>Auditing Strategy and Techniques Applied

</h3>
                    <p>Throughout the review process, care was taken to check the repository
for security-related issues, code quality, and compliance with
specifications and best practices. To this end, our team of experienced
pen-testers andsmart contract developers reviewed the code line by
line and documentedany issues discovered.</p><p>We check every file manually. We use automated tools only so that
they helpus achieve faster andbetter results.</p><p>Code review that includes the following:
a. Reviewing the specifications, sources, and instructions
provided to
SolidProof to ensure we understand the size, scope, and
functionality of the
smart contract.
b. Manual review of the code, i.e., reading the source code line
by line to identify potential vulnerabilities.
c. Comparison to the specification, i.e., verifying that the code
does what is described in the sp</p>
                    <p>2. Testing and automated analysis that includes the following:
a. Test coverage analysis determines whether test cases cover
codeand how much code is executed when those test cases
are executed.
b. Symbolic execution, which is analysing a program to
determine what inputs cause each part of a program to
execute</p><p>3. Review best practices, i.e., review smart contracts to improve efficiency,
effectiveness, clarity, maintainability, security, and control based on
best practices, recommendations, and research from industry and
academia.</p><p>4. Concrete, itemized and actionable recommendations to help you
secure your smart contracts.</p><h4>OUTSMART THE MARKET WITH $WAI –
WienerAI’s Predictive Technology</h4>

                    <p>WienerAI’s predictive technology, combined with its user-friendly AI interface, allows you to instantly scour the crypto market for those hidden gems. Ask WienerAI to find your next trade and it delivers the market analysis to help you win more often. Then seamlessly swap, MEV-free, through decentralized exchanges.

</p><h3>The Technology Behind
WienerAI Recommendations

</h3>
<p>To avoid potential hacking risks, it is advisable for the client to manage
the private key of the privileged account with care. Additionally, we
recommend enhancing the security practices of centralized privileges
or roles in the protocol through a decentralized mechanism or smartcontract-based accounts, such asmulti-signature wallets.</p>
<p>Consider using multi-signature wallets: Multi-signature wallets
require multiple parties to sign off on a transaction before it can be
executed, providing an extra layer of security e.g. Gnosis Safe
- Use of a timelock at least with a latency of e.g. 48-72 hours for
awareness of privileged operations</p><p>Introduce a DAO/Governance/Voting module to increase
transparency and user involvement
- Consider Renouncing the ownership so that the owner cannot
modify any state variables of the contract anymore. Make sure to set
up everything before renouncing.</p>


                    
<h3>Building the Sausage Army</h3>
    <p>In order to achieve total domination of the decentralized world, WienerAI is
going to need some help. That’s why he’s building his Sausage Army–
thousands and thousands of ultra-loyal wiener lovers that will help spread
the positivity that Wiener AI brings, as well as echo the message that
Wiener AI is the ultimate cybernetic being in the entire universe. His fans
grow by the thousands. His Sausage Army is almost ready to march–will you
join them on their quest?</p>
                    

        <h3>The $WAI Token:</h3>
    <p>$WAI is an ERC20 token on the Ethereum Blockchain and is the WienerAI
        trading bot’s native token</p>

        <h3>Upgradeability:</h3>
    <p>AI’s capabilities are only scratching the surface of what will be possible in
        the near and distant future. For this reason, Wiener is infinitely upgradable
        and has modular technological capabilities. WienerAI will always be at the
        cutting edge of AI technological advancement.</p>
        <h4>MEV Protection</h4>
        <p>Never get frontrun by a MEV bot again. A MEV or Sandwich bot is a type of
trading bot that profits from price differences on decentralized exchanges
(DEXs). When it does so, it frontruns your trade in order to minimize your
gain. WienerAI gets you in front of every frontrunner.

Not just a bot; but an AI-powered crypto trading partner designed to give
YOU the advantage you’ve been searching for.</p>
